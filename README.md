I like the dark [VS Code GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) very much. So I created this one for Chrome in order to use it for both tools.

You can [install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-theme/gmjnabaaiekoldfegadnbgaadoaijbjn) or directly load the `/theme` folder as an unpacked extension.
